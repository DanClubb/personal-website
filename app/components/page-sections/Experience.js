        Zone has given me almost 2 years of professional experience as a
        frontend developer. During this time I worked large scale client
        projects. <strong>Elextrolux</strong> on their online retail store, and{" "}
        <strong>Greene King</strong> enhancing a web app for table reservations
        at Greene King pubs. I also spent time working on an

        I grew a lot in this time both as a developer and as a person which is
        refelected in positive feedback I received which often highlighted that
        I learn quickly and have potential to continue to grow as a developer as
        well as my ability to build strong relationships and work as part of a
        team.
